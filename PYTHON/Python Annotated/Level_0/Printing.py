######################
#This is the stereotypical intro to Programming
#In most languages the first thing that you will 
#learn is how to make the program output 
#"Hello World"
######################

#In Python this task is quite simple

print ("Hello World") #Hit F5 to run the program
#######################After you have tried this
#######################Add a '#' (Hashtag) in
#######################front of the first line

#There are a few different ways to print
#print will detect what you want to print
#print (12)
#remove the hashtag from the line above and rerun 
#the program after you are done running it replace
#the Hashtag

#This next part will involve a variable which we'll 
#cover in the next lesson 

x = 243

#print (x)
#remove the hashtag and run the program
#you can see that the program used data it 'learned'
#earlier in the program to execute the print
#more on this in the next lesson
