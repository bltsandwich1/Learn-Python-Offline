ABOUT Level_0
=============

 - Level_0 is meant to introduce the user to programming by running predeveloped code, and then they will develop there own code to produce a certain output/response

 - All of the subjects covered are covered in a very basic form which is a key distinction from the higher levels. It is also based more on running predeveloped code than the others are. Higher levels tend to shy towards more programming on the user end.
