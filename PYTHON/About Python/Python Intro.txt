So... What is Python?

Python is a programming language that is used around the world in both
educational and practical settings. Python is one of the big three 
languages that Google uses, and is well regarded as one of the best 
'Learning Languages'. Python was initially designed to be an easy
to read language, and therefore is understandable without the excesive
commenting that is neccessary for some other languages. That means 
that if I look at the code that you wrote in Python I should be able
to figure out what is does (but good efficient commenting certainly 
helps).
