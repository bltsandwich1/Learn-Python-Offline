#Printing 2

#we already know that python is great for
#printing data, but there are things that
#make it even nicer.

#First predict what will happen when the 
#program below is run. (it's perfectly 
#fine if you don't know)

x = 'I '
y = 'like'
z = 'programming!!!'

print (x, y, z)

#interesting what comes out right? this can
#be incredibly useful when you are outputting
#large amounts of data, but still want 
#organization.

a = 1 
b = 42
c = 'dog'

print (a, b, c) #Here's an example of Python
###############being able to distinguish
###############two types of data

#There are strings and integers. integers
#are numbers, and strings are held within quotes
#and are text, so you can't multiply strings.
