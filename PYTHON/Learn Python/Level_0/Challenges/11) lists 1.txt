create a program that will print out 2 lists. one the list of the first 5 prime numbers, and the second a list of 1-5 cubed.

the output should look like this.

[2, 3, 5, 7, 11] [1, 8, 27, 64, 125]

or this:

[2, 3, 5, 7, 11] 
[1, 8, 27, 64, 125]


Tip: don't feel like you have to generate the numbers using the program (although we will do this in a later challenge), you can just add them to the list like in the example
