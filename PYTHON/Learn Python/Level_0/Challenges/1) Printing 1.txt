Alright so now it's time for your first challenge. There will be one or even multiple challenge files for each file teaching a new concept.

For each challenge you should create a unique python file. In addition, this file should not be located within the file system of this repository. The easiest thing to do is to create a folder on the desktop, and save your work there.

So... as we've see you can print text to the Python interpreter. Try to make the python interpreter output the following (w/o quotes)

"Project LEAD is based in Chicago"
