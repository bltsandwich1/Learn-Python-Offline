#Now that you know a little about how variables 
#can be defined and redefined we'll cover our first
#type of loop. The 'while' loop
####

#the 'while' loop says that as long as something 
#that you define is true, it should perform an
#operation

#For Example

x = 0
while (x<10):
        print (x)
        x += 1 #using += can save time programming when
################you want to add a number to a variable
	########you could also format it like below 
	########		x = x + 1 
	########but this takes more time (so why do it)




#First, predict what you think this will do.
#Run this program to see what it does.
#did you think right?
