There are a lot of ways that you can involve a variable in function.

Here's a list of common ways:

add: x+y
subtract: x-y
multiply: x*y
divide: x/y
to the power: x**y (read aloud: 'x to the y')

There are also statements
greater than: x>y
less than: x<y
greater than or equal to: x>=y
less than or equal to: x<=y
not equal to: x!=y (in programming '!' is called 'bang'
