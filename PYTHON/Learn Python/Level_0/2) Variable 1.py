#Congrats on your first program!
#
#Now we are going to be introduced to variables
#variables are just the same in Python as they are
#in Math class
#
#Let's investigate them a little.
####

x = 0 #This tells the program that x (a variable) is equal to zero
#######If we want to check this we can command the program print (x)
print (x) 

#Just as we suspected this produces '0'

#A great thing about programming languages is that you have an unlimited 
#number of variables. 

A_New_Variable = 778 #Note that variables can even be words w/o spaces
print (A_New_Variable)

#Clearly Python can handle 2 variables no problem (it can handle ANY #)
#Recomment the last 2 print functions
