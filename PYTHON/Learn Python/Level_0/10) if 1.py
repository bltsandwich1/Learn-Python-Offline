#If statements
####

#Sometimes you want program to do one thing if a certain condition
#is met, and something else if it is not. if statements help us
#with this
import sys

x = int(input('#?')) #We will go over this later. in interpreter
##########################it will prompt you for a number. press
##########################enter w/ your number
if x<135: #your 'if' statement. if the conditional after the 'if' is
    #######true the program will do something.
    print ('kinda small number huh?')
else: #'else' is one of the close pals of 'if'. it basically tells the
    ###computer, that if the 'if' statement isn't true do something
    print ('such a big number!!!')
