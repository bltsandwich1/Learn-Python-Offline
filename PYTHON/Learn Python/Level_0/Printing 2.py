#Printing 2
###

#we already know that python is great for
#printing data, but there are things that
#make it even nicer.

#First predict what will happen when the 
#program below is run. (it's perfectly 
#fine if you don't know)

x = 'I '
y = 'like '
z = 'programming!!!'

print (x, y, z)

#interesting what comes out right? this can
#be incredibly useful when you are outputting
#large amounts of data, but still want 
#organization.
