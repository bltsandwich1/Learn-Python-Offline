#Some more on variables

#Variables are easily redefined. 

#Let's start simple.

x=2 #x is going to start at 2
print (x) 
x=54 #we are redefining x to equal 54
print (x) 
x= "Cheese" #x is now the string 'cheese'
print (x)

#Clearly variables can be manipulated easily,
#this can make them very useful
