About
=====

There are a TON of free online resources that can help teach you Python. However there is a lack of free OFFLINE resources (this was noticed while using the Raspberry Pi and therefore is designed with it in mind). Project LEAD (Learn Everything Applying DIY) is aiming to change that with this repository. While the content contained will never reach that of online sources, it surely will be an excellent start, and will help teach most of the fundamentals of Python and of programming.
