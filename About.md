About (Github file)
===================
This will cover a little about the creators of the project, how the project is (and will be) progressing, and a brief implementation plan for teachers (or anyone using this repo)

The Creators:
=============
The initial creators and managers of this repository are all members of the Board for Project LEAD and Illinois Not-For-Profit corporation. Project LEAD (Learn Everything Applying DIY) creates and compiles digital content. Project LEAD produces YouTube videos (youtube.com/user/projectleadiit) and manages a Facebook page (facebook.com/iitProjectLEAD). Project LEAD's goal is to encourage more people to become interested and active in the STEM (Sci, Tech, Engr, and Math) fields. Everything we do must comply to 3 C's Creative, Complimentary, and Content.

The Creators have been joined by others in modifying and annotating the code that is within.

Project Plan:
=============

Currently there are 2 main parts that are planned for the Repository
 - About the Raspberry Pi --- This will contain a host of information that is off-line and therefore freely viewable to the user. 
 - Learning Pyhton --- This will contain a compilation of the best tutorials and learning material. It will be available to download in annotated and non-annotated versions (a single download will contain both.
 
 Future plans that we would like to implement but that aren't currently in the pipeline (and why)
  - Learning C --- The more languages we can get the better, but C is not the forte of anybody currently on the team. 
  - Learning Bash --- We do not have a Bash master on the team, but we may include an intro to Bash.
