Welcome to the Project LEAD Python Repository. If you have dowloaded this from github, GREAT, if this has come on your SD card (some Raspberry Pi users), thank you for the download.

Here's a sequenced list of what you need to do in order to have the most productive experience possible.

 - Create a folder on your desktop where you can keep all of your pyhton programs. This should be separate from the folder you have the repository in to prevent anything weird happening with a repository update. (we wouldn't want you to lose your work)
 - Go into the Rpi-Python folder and then the PYTHON folder.
 - From there you can either learn a little about Python (about Python) or you can actually start learning how to code in Pyhton (Learn Python -> Level_0)
